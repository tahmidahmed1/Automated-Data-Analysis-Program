# DATA-ANALYSIS-AUTOMATION-PROGRAM

## Description:

This is a data analysis automation program I created for a local hospital I volunteered at. It takes in CSV files and can point out which patients were disappointed with the services provided by the hospital. Since there are many departments in the hospital, a lot of information would flow in, taking the analysis very long to complete. With this program, only bad rating show up to maximize the time spent on solving the problem.
